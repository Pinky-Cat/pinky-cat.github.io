Where did the 3rd Eye team go after making this game?

For Itteu, Back in 2020, he was a writer for Sakuya Wars during Touhou Station Game Jam 1, and submitted photos for a Touhou photography exhibit. As of 2024, Ittetu currently writes posts about Magic the Gathering, and while he has not written any works involving Touhou, he does likes to make many comparisons to Touhou.

After Usamata’s introduction to the doujin world, she continued on her own doujin actitivies by drawing her own art. Back in 2020, Usamata worked with Kotoinari to create the Gone Children animation with OPTPiX SpriteStudio. As of 2024, Usamata is still active on her doujin circle, creating doujinshi on Uma Musume Pretty Derby. She also still has close tabs with the other members of 3rd Eye as she sometimes contributes art and animation to doujin circle Ridil and as seen from her Twitter account, retweets Kotoinari’s art.

Kotoinari has a very visible art history for a Touhou artist as they drew a new art piece everyday. As for their work after 3rd Eye, after the turn to 2019, Kotoinari would place a focus on original works and stop drawing Touhou. That focus would lead to the creation of their own OCs, Gone Children, as well as an increased frequency of drawings of Western works and Western films. Kotoinari would continue on this path until late 2021, when their Twitter account started to repost previous art works, and reduced the amount of new drawings. Then in 2022, Kotoinari would stop reposting and begin to post new art again, except it was no longer daily. I give some of their Twitter posts on their thoughts about drawing art daily.

Ridil continued to release new albums until COVID-19 hit, then they became inactive. However, they have recently come back and are currently active on their YouTube channel with a new vocal arrangement of “U.N. Owen was Her?” on their YouTube channel. Aside from being active, the YouTube account has posted comments about game development.

The first comment is a reply to a fan about a possible “3rd eye2” to which Ridil responded with, 

> ありがとうございます！3Rdeye2ではありませんが同じチームで新しい企画を製作中です。
> 
> **DeepL Translation**
> 
> Thank you! We are working on a new project, not 3rdeye2, but the same team is working on a new project. 

Assuming the DeepL translation is accurate, the “same team” wording is confusing. At best, I can say everyone from 3rd Eye except for Kotoinari. I really can’t think of Kotoinari drawing art for another doujin game given their shift in artstyle. Now, the “new project” could be something else or “カゲフミ-kagefumi-”, a game Nishimura was working on after the development of 3rd Eye wrapped up in late 2019. This game is described as a “2D Survival Horror Indie Game” according to the four music tracks released so far on Ridil’s Soundcloud. As for what the game is about, that contained in the music tracks’ description.

> 誰もいなくなった夕暮れの町。
> そこに待っているのは
> とっても怖くて、とっても懐かしい
> カゲのうごめく不思議な世界･･･
> 
> **DeepL Translation**
> 
> An empty town at dusk.
> What awaits you there is
> A very scary and very nostalgic
> A mysterious world where lizards roam... 

Thankfully, the music tracks also describe where they are used in this game: boss fights. They even describe the names of these boss fights to be “Tsuchigumo”, “Ryoumen-sukuna”, “Hajiro-kumawasi”, and “Amatsu-Mikaboshi”. Google search leads to dead ends, but I can guess this game will be taking from Japanese mythology for the setting.

As for the second comment, it is a response to a console port of 3rd Eye. This comment was posted 4 months ago from January 2024. This console port was promised way back at 2019. It turns out that Sairoutine is responsible for the porting job.

Sairoutine has continued to set up his doujin circle “Sunflower Game” at doujin events until 2023, showing off his games like “宇佐見蓮子の大事な約束”, “紫と霊夢の終わらない夏”, and 3rd Eye. Aside from that, Sairoutine took on programming job since 2020 which can shown by the amount of private GitHub commits post-2020 jumping to the hundreds. As for the 3rd Eye port, Sairoutine referenced it in his Hatena Blog.

> 2019年05月にパッケージ版をリリース、10月にSteam版をリリースしました。
> それなりの数が売れて、国内外から感想や実況プレイ頂き嬉しかったです。
> これと本業の収入で今年は年収が大台超えたので良かったです。
> (禊みたいなものなので、一度経験しておくと、今後年収がどうで人生の意思決定をしなくて済む)
> 一緒に制作したメンバーからも、またこのメンバーで作りたいといってもらえたのが良かったです。
> またこのメンバーでゲーム作りたいね。
> 一方で、Switch/PS4版も予定しているのですが、こちらは全く進捗がなかったので、これは反省点です。
> (Unity 移植にあたって、Unityに取り組む意欲が持てず、5月から12月を過ごしてしまった)
> 意欲が持てなかった原因を振り返ると、以下です。
> 
> - 同じものの作り直しでワクワクしない
> - Unity で作るイメージが持てない(他人が作った道筋通りにやるのが苦手)
> - Unity における GUI操作を覚えるのが苦手
> - パッケージ版の完成で燃え尽きた
> - プラットフォームとしてゲーム機やスマートフォンよりブラウザの方が好き
> - 技術的にハックしている感じがしない(人がやってないことをやってる感)
> - Unityコミュニティに所属してないので、承認が動機にならない
> - 仕事でプログラミングから離れてたせいか、新しい技術を学んで完成品を作る力が弱った
> 
> **DeepL Translation**
> 
> The packaged version was released in May 2019 and the Steam version in October 2019.
> 
> We sold a good number of copies and were happy to receive feedback and play-by-play from both inside and outside of Japan.
> With this and my main business income, I am happy to say that my annual income has exceeded the big mark this year.
> (It's like misogi, so once you experience it, you won't have to make life decisions based on your annual income in the future.)
> 
> It was good to hear from the members who worked with me that they would like to make games with this group again.
> I would like to make games with this group again.
> 
> On the other hand, we are also planning to make a Switch/PS4 version, but there was no progress at all on this one, so this is something to reflect on.
> (In the Unity port, I spent May to December without the motivation to work on Unity.)
> 
> Looking back at the reasons for my lack of motivation, here are some of the reasons
> 
> - I was not excited about making the same thing over and over again.
> - I don't have an image of what I want to create in Unity (I am not good at following the path that others have created).
> - Not good at learning GUI operations in Unity
> - Burned out after completing the packaged version
> - Prefer browser to console or smartphone as a platform
> - I don't feel like I'm technically hacking (I feel like I'm doing something that other people aren't doing)
> - I don't belong to the Unity community, so approval is not a motivation
> - I've been away from programming for work, which has weakened my ability to learn new skills and create a finished product 

According to this post, Sairoutine is responsible for the 3rd Eye port and that he is not motivated to work on the port. Given that this post was made on February 10, 2020, perhaps Sairoutine has progressed farther on the 3rd Eye port. Either way, Sairoutine has placed less focus on developing games thanks to his new job, through it is unknown what the private GitHub repositories could be. It could be about the “new project” Ridil mentioned.

If you read all this reports, which can be found on the other YouTube uploads of the 3rd Eye soundtrack, I hope you have learned more about how this horror Touhou game came to be.
As a bonus, here is an assorted list of artworks Kotoinari has done over the years.
