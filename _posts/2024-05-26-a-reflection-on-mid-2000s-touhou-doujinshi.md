Today, I read [*The Right Tools For The Job*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43380529?view_full_work=true) by freshlybakedspiderbread, managing to humor me with very in-character characterization of Kogasa, Raiko, and Sakuya, yet this characterization does not prevent this fanfiction to be one of the most funniest pieces of Touhou fanfiction I ever read. With such good characterization on Touhou characters, it made me consider that Touhou fanworks in today's era have evolved their writing to use more details of Touhou's setting when compared to mid-2000s Touhou doujinshi.

I used to read all the Touhou doujinshi I could find, going on a [reading journey](https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/) to begin reading [Dynasty Reader](https://dynasty-scans.com/doujins/touhou_project) releases from 2006 to 2019, starting when the [first scanlated Touhou doujinshi](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/its_not_a_dream) was released on the internet. This journey was completed on June 27, 2023, and is currently saved as a highlighted doujinshi list on Tachiyomi.

In reflection of my reading journey, I find that most doujinshi from the mid-2000s don't hold up to today's standards on Touhou fanworks. These doujinshi employ [Outside World jokes](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-16699), play on [shallow characterization](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-371808), or focus too much on being a parody. These doujinshi don't feel very 'Touhou' as its unique setting is ignored to serve as a stepping stone for comedy or parodies, instead of writing with the Touhou setting in mind.

This is not to say that there were no mid-2000s doujinshi that don’t write with the setting of Touhou, though I can only think of [Two by This Side, Three by the Other Side](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/md-8c4423d2-e676-4ff7-8a46-b5e00970d8cb)* by Personal Color for its exploration on the relationship with Yuyuko and Yukari. Still, I believe that Touhou fans back in the mid-2000s treated the Touhou setting as more humorous compared to today due to the setting being more transcendent in details without the likes of *Forbidden Scrollery* and *Wild and Horned Hermit*.

And I noticed during my reading journey that as Touhou grows a more mature setting as ZUN wrote additional youkai, systems, and worlds into Touhou, the more doujinshi that were written with more thematic meaning. Prime exemplars: [*Suzu and the Little Bird*](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-303532), [*Jukai no Ito*](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-305719), [doujinshi of Fantasy Engineering Works](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/?q=artist:fantasy_engineering_works), and [doujinshi of Zounose](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/?q=artist:zounose). Each of these doujinshi engrosses within the setting of Touhou by playing with the additional elements ZUN added to Touhou's setting.

To take what I have said about adding Touhou's setting to Touhou fanworks, let's come back to *The Right Tools For The Job*  and point out that its humor happens with character traits for each Touhou characters it uses. Since its humor are based on their existing character traits, I am not surprised the story would take a twist on their character before showing Sakuya on a tangent about preparing human dishes while everyone around gives her odd looks. And I am not surprised that Raiko would play the role of professional drummer even in the most perilous situations. If I such a work was written in the mid-2000s, I would expect the jokes to be imported from other outside sources instead of being organically created by the Touhou characters themselves.

That is what I think as the quality difference between a fanwork of today compared to the mid-2000s, the enrichment of Touhou's setting. Glad to see that the Touhou community been able to move to creation over importing as to creates works that can stand on its own merits.

By the way, I would like to list the following Touhou fanworks as my own recommendations for quality Touhou fanworks:

- [*The Right Tools For The Job*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43380529?view_full_work=true) - for giving me the spark to write this piece for its excellent in-character writing.
- [*suite ad astra*](https://crescentia.bandcamp.com/album/suite-ad-astra) - for the bringing an array of moods as I wrote this by being a wonderful orchestral album.
- [*Moon River*](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/eol6d1/i_just_finished_typesetting_my_favorite_doujin/) - for referencing a song that one might find for *Breakfast at Tiffany's*.
- [*Stroke of Fake*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7nsZn9k8Q) - as one of the few Touhou Ska albums out there.
- [*プリズムリバー三姉妹のソロ!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50HLMUWAdaw) - by creating an [analysis](https://note.com/yuki_02010/n/nc766fe2e4128) on the Prismriver sisters to create the album.
- [*A Strange Dance Gathering*](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-1130662) - as an amusing short story featuring Alice's dolls.
