There are four domains that Touhou mobile apps can fall under: Gacha, Collaboration, Derivative Games, and Indie/Doujin Game Development. This is to describe the differences in development styles for Touhou mobile and for what purpose these apps are created for. Depending on what one looks for in a Touhou mobile app, there may be traits in given by the domain that a Touhou app should not be, thus the need to categorize Touhou apps under domains.

## 1. Gacha
These apps have to be semi-official Touhou works approved by Team Shanghai Alice (TSA) due to their monetization method. Also, these games are the most popular of Touhou apps because they have the development team has a big budget, allowing them to create high-quality art/music for the Touhou characters. These are the mobile Touhou apps that most people will talk about and acts as a bridge for Touhou for those who lack access to computers.

## 2. Collaboration
Mobile collaborations of Touhou are technically not a form of a Touhou app, but any mention of Touhou on mobile is rare, so these collaborations shall be mentioned. Most of these collaborations are rhythm games thanks to their licensing of Touhou music, but there is one notable exception to the rhythm game Touhou collabs.
That is the mobile version of Dandy Dungeon, a collab that could only happen thanks to the development team of Onion Games being friends with ZUN. This collab was run on November 2016 for Japan, and November 2017 for everywhere else.

### Examples
- [Dandy Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1lduPTVSY) – A roguelike RPG game that has a release on Steam/Switch. The Touhou collab was brought over to its Steam/Switch version, so this odd collab is still playable today.

## 3. Derivative Games
Derivative Games refer to games that are based on another game, usually being a reskin due to their ease of effort. However, there are some games that try to change the mechanics to fit with the Touhou themes, which will be mentioned under “Examples” to award their efforts.

## 4. Indie/Doujin Game Development
These are the apps that either are original game concepts, are artistic doujin works, or are ports of Touhou fangames on PC. This is the most interesting domain of Touhou apps as it helps bring quality genres to the mobile space and push the boundaries on what mobile phones can do.
Note, that not all apps are on the app store. Some of them are only on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/games/platform-android/tag-touhou) or on a doujin creator’s website.
