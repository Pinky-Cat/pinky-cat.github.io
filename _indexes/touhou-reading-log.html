<p>It's no secret of mine that I am a big fan of literature and Touhou. But dissussion on these works are few and far in between, as such this reading log will serve as a space where I write down my thoughts on Touhou literature.</p>

<h2>Season 1 (November 2024)</h2>
<p>My first forway with the reading log started on the Moriya Shrine forum during November 2024, under the thread <a href="https://moriyashrine.org/forums/topic/7559-touhou-reading-log/">Touhou Reading Log</a>, where I try to read and write about a piece of Touhou literature for each day of November. Writing daily was inspired by the NaNoWriMo challenge and acted as an excuse to start reading my massive backlog of Touhou literature I have compiled for the past year.</p>
<ol>
    {% assign touhou-reading-log = site.indexes-extras | where:"tags","touhou-reading-log-s1" %}
    {% for item in touhou-reading-log %}
    <li>
        <a href='{{item.url}}'>{{item.title}}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ol>

<h2>Season 2 (2025)</h2>
<p>Before I started doing more reviews, I decided to check out other people's reviews of Touhou fanworks.</p>
<ol>
    {% assign touhou-reading-log = site.indexes-extras | where:"tags","touhou-reading-log-s2" %}
    {% for item in touhou-reading-log %}
    <li>
        <a href='{{item.url}}'>{{item.title}}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ol>
