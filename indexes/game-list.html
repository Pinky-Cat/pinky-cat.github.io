<p>For each game I have played, I keep track of it on a list for the purposes of recording my gaming experiences over the years. Also, feel free to use these lists as a way to explore for games not on mainstream storefronts, for every game not on Steam has been linked to their game page to ease accessibility on playing these games.</p>

<p>For this year, a summary poster was created detailing the games I liked.</p>

<p>For this year, the list started to keep track of additional information about how I played these games. In addition, three summary videos were made to roundup the footage I have recorded throughout the year.</p>
