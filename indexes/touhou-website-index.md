## Foreword
As an index extension to Raxelgrande's [Awesome Touhou](https://github.com/Raxelgrande/awesome-touhou) and to the wishes expressed in [The Independent Web of 2hu - A Dream of Eastern Turnpikes](https://www.tekitou.moe/posts/2023-04-18-tuhupike.html), this index will catalog any parts of the web that contain any noteworthy Touhou content.
Unlike Awesome Touhou, this index focuses on curating Touhou content for historical value. Despite the age and size of the Touhou community, there has been little effort taken for a community news reporting source, thus it is rather difficult to look back on what the community has done in the past.
Feel free to contact me for any suggestion to this list under the contacts listed under this [channel](https://youtube.com/@pinkycat0110?si=srPFXeVHIOWXEePD).
