<p>This is the 2024 edition for the <a href="/indexes/game-list.html">End of the Year Game Lists</a>. For this year, I decided to create a summary for the games I liked for year, which can be found by scrolling down beyond this game list. Additionaly, I decided to standardize game titles and additional information to improve the readability of these lists. </p>

<h2 id="summary jan-mar">January &ndash; March</h2>
<a href="\images\indexes-extras\game-list\2024\January - March.webp"><img src="\images\indexes-extras\game-list\2024\January - March.webp" style="max-height:400px;" /></a>
<h3><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/tower-of-heaven/1859">Tower of Heaven</a></h3>
<p>It is a short platformer, but there is an amazing experience from the player challenging Tower&rsquo;s attempts to stop the player from climbing to the top. In the meanwhile, the soundtrack adapts to the player&rsquo;s feelings, giving off the ascent to challenge against what is possible.</p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971650/OCTOPATH_TRAVELER_II/">Octopath Traveler II</a></h3>
<p>This sequel adds on to what the first game did, and makes it even better. With the world bigger as the landmass became two continents separated by ocean, there a lot of surprises that makes this game give off the sense of traveling. Plus, there are key improvements to each of the classes, which was especially noticed for the hunter class as I picked Ochette as my starting character. Through, I can&rsquo;t say I liked all of the traveler&rsquo;s story equally, like Oswald and Cassti, due to following on cliches too much, there one route liked more than the others. Partitio&rsquo;s route involves networking with people and going through the process of building up markets from the ground up which is unique in how the gameplay ties well with Partitio to make his story feel more than an objective. Overall, I find Octopath Traveler II to be a good sequel to Octopath Traveler I, retaining the strong sense of travel within its themes.</p>
<h3><a href="https://4331pro.itch.io/gunvomit">She Vomited Guns</a></h3>
<p>A short visual novel that is framed as a doctor&rsquo;s checkup on a being named Nina. Nina can produce weapons of destruction, and as such the doctor&rsquo;s checkup is to keep on making sure that Nina can keep making these weapons. The best way it turns out was to keep Nina trapped in a world of lies, by feeding her the praise she needs while she stuck in a room built to produce war weapons. Between the visual novel&rsquo;s dull palette and empty space, this short experience tells much about the contrast between the care and purpose of suppliers.</p>

<h3><a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety/">Adventures with Anxiety</a></h3>
<p>What makes Nicky&rsquo;s narrative games popular is her use of animated visuals, strong sense of humor, and more importantly, direct references to our world. Of course, Adventures with Anxiety is no different from her other works, with the main focus on Anxiety, a living animal who has to keep control of a human from making poor decisions. I like how the narrative makes Anxiety tell the human to do some wacky decisions relating their sandwich to underline the obvious issues with Anxiety. Then, the narrative go into deeper issues where Anxiety is helpful, putting a twist on the purpose of Anxiety. Glad to read a narrative that reads from the modern present.</p>
<h3><a href="https://fionakaenbyou.itch.io/deep-sea-dating">Deep Sea Dating</a></h3>
<p>A simple Touhou visual novel. I wouldn&rsquo;t say the writing is anything more special than other stories that tackle with scorned relationships, but the artist&rsquo;s visuals and the use of stock music let just enjoy what Wakasagihime and Kagerou has for each other.</p>
<h3><a href="https://char64.itch.io/partyproject">Party Project</a></h3>
<p>Its Mario Party, but with customization options. Seriously, the game allows for so many options to customization the experience from minigame selection, item inventory, to star spawning. Plus, this game is still getting updates for new content, balance changes, and bug fixes. Need I say that it is also possible to mod in your own custom characters? It&rsquo;s like as if Nintendo was more concerned about consumers, then Party Project would be the Mario Party we would have.</p>

<h2 id="summary jul-sep">July &ndash; September</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.katawa-shoujo.com/">Katawa Shoujo</a></h3>
<p>My experience with this visual novel is going to differ from other experiences with visual novels I have had before, as I played on the Android release based on the Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered version, allowing for me to read this on the go. I figured out a lesson from this; this is a game format that works on mobile. When it just reading, it is much more easier to interact when it doesn&rsquo;t involve any precision, especially when one chooses to play a mobile game on a car. But let&rsquo;s get back to the main subject of a visual novel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the words to describe in detail the specifics of Katawa Shoujo&rsquo;s writing that made it so appealing to me. It&rsquo;s like trying to describe an experience born out of imaginable conditions, that trying to recreate the experience by writing is going against a rock. Though, can say that its writing can describe both the relaxing slice of life experiences while being able to build up and tackle serious moments with a form of resolution for its characters. It also helped that the writing for its characters tended to not follow character tropes. What I can say more confidently is that its UI is bright and light, appealing to the visual novel&rsquo;s genre. Also, the music and sound design are excellent to set up the mood for its scenes, and I find myself in occasion listening to the music as background noise outside of the visual novel as it is somehow a perfect sense of &ldquo;strength&rdquo; as noise. It&rsquo;s not too strong nor too weak to work with this music. Anyway, I feel that Katawa Shoujo filled a niche I was lacking in both literature and gaming, that no other piece media has filled, at least to the length of over 15 hours. With its length, it was possible think about the themes and characters over multiple days, while bridging in other experiences and media together to gain better understanding. Goodness, I can&rsquo;t say if where I find another experience like Katawa Shoujo, but for all of its worth, it is a good visual novel to read through.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, I want to highlight in my research that I conducted after I finished reading the visual novel that this visual novel happens to be quite important for both the development of visual novels in the West and for its topic about disabilities. I especially want to highlight the <span style="color: #000080;"><a href="https://lparchive.org/Katawa-Shoujo/">SA thread</a></span> for this game, as it gives greater context on the game&rsquo;s writing, while also acting as a place where the experiences of disabilities can be talked in an open environment. Truly, I did not expect that a game could have such positive impact all these years later.</p>
<h3><a href="http://egomassive.com/ks/">Knytt Stories</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a level creator, but I love this atmosphere to it thanks to its UI design and sound design. I can&rsquo;t describe the game&rsquo;s design well, but it like a terminal waiting for commands? Possibilities? Regardless, I hold this game up as its community has made some well-made levels over the years that weave in environmental storytelling to direct its level design.</p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1271300/Methods_The_Detective_Competition/">Methods: The Detective Competition</a></h3>
<p>If I have to describe this visual novel, it feels like a series of fantasy novels with characters that feel like JoJo that embark on the goal to win on a competition with many mysteries. Despite never reading JoJo before, I use the term &ldquo;JoJo&rdquo; as my own shorthand to describe how every characters all have a special ability that influences their personality in both of the mystery-solving sense and in the social sense. As such, the character interactions that happen, especially with a cast as large as Methods is an appealing feature to it. Also, the creator&rsquo;s visual style certainly gives a different vibe off, that certainly differs from media influenced from Asia, and more of the &ldquo;off the walls&rdquo; vibes if I could describe it.</p>
<h3><a href="https://friendsea.booth.pm/items/1738759">Genso Flood Front</a></h3>
<p>This is a game that made me want to speedrun a game for the first time. It&rsquo;s thanks to its fluid controls, that I was able to find the game reasonable to practice attempts over and over again. Plus, I found the discovery of exploits and bugs a thrilling time as I researched on other people&rsquo;s speedrun tricks that I replicated and improved on to create my own speedrun. I can&rsquo;t wait to play <span style="font-family: Calibri;">ゲンソウインベンタ</span>when it releases when FriendSea is finished with <span style="font-family: Calibri;">モリヤリズム </span>RAINBOW. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_HPCvLiAQCI?si=539dXqjwM26D2YrV">The trial version I have seen for <span style="font-family: Calibri;">ゲンソウインベンタ</span></a> indicates it is an expanded version of Genso Flood Front, with more enemies types, slopes, 2.5D layer levels, and even a <a href="https://x.com/friendsea95/status/1450416075087118339">level editor</a>! If there is a Touhou game that I am most excited for, its <span style="font-family: Calibri;">ゲンソウインベンタ</span>, and that all the more reason why I rate Genso Flood Front so highly along Touhou fangames. It has a good sense of game design that is easy to control, hard to master, and surprising in its game mechanics.</p>

<h3><a href="https://killmondaygames.com/fran-bow/">Fran Bow</a></h3>
<p>I feel Flan Bow has layers to unravel with its narrative with how its chapters referenced characters and events throughout multiple chapters, and by placing subtle hints to foreshadow future plot points in the story. By making sure the chapters built up on preexisting elements of its narrative, it allowed for me to start questioning what Flan Bow really experienced, place meaning of the cosmic layers, and think about the nature of the characters Flan Bow met on her journey. But even if I didn&rsquo;t engage with theorizing about the truth in Flan Bow, there a good sense of world building as each chapter place details on the environment Flan Bow find herself in, making the setting feel more alive than a collection of puzzles. Plus, I did enjoy the characters, especially the skeleton and the axolotl. They give off good vibes in two separate directions. Through, I found that the end of the game didn&rsquo;t give me a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps it is the rushed pacing the final chapter does between describing details on its environment and getting the player to complete a bunch of puzzles, but thankfully the narrative has layers to analyze that aren&rsquo;t so obvious on a first read that makes the ending just an end marker on the game&rsquo;s narrative. Also, there are some classic point and click puzzles that aren&rsquo;t so obvious, which can kill the pacing of the narrative by having the player stuck. That being said, overall I find Flan Bow&rsquo;s narrative to be engaging both on a first read and by analysis thanks to its world building and shared narrative points across chapters.</p>
<h3><a href="https://x.com/yomogi_soft/status/1834566490575495281">Cirno&rsquo;s Bomb-Tastic Adventure</a></h3>
<p>An isometric puzzle game about Cirno blowing up enemies with the least amount of bombs possible. The game is divided into worlds, each introducing new bombs and mechanics that keep the puzzles fresh. For example, there could be tiles that break after a bomb passes over them, forcing Cirno to find another way to get the bomb to blow up the enemy. This world structure fits nicely for mobile play, allowing for players to pickup the game on the go without needing to remember previous mechanics from before. Though, this game can get tricky with its puzzles in the game&rsquo;s bonus worlds and bonus stages, so puzzle difficulty can become very high if the player wishes to tackle on them. My only issue with this game is the lack of a soundtrack as the game only has one puzzle theme for the entire game. While this is partly not an issue for mobile play, it would have been nice to hear a complete Touhou puzzle game soundtrack, like the soundtrack for Kubinashi Recollection. All in all, I did not expect that there could be a good puzzle game for mobile devices, much less a good Touhou mobile game. Yet, that is what I got in Cirno&rsquo;s Bomb-Tastic Adventure.</p>
<h3><a href="https://veyeralgames.com/">The Void Rains Upon Her Heart</a></h3>
<p>For a roguelike shoot em&rsquo; up, I like how relaxed this game is. I point to how the game allows the player options on which enemy to fight against, which for a shoot em&rsquo; up is excellent for allowing the player to choose fights they feel more comfortable doing. Also, this game does not reward the player for beating enemies the fastest, but rather on consistency, encouraging practicing attack patterns over steamrolling enemies with extra items. Add this to the game&rsquo;s rainy UI and wide lore, and it makes this roguelike feel less of an optimization problem, and more of a proper game.</p>

<h3><a href="https://se-made.com/voidstranger.html">Void Stranger</a></h3>
<p>If you know, you know. But if I have to add more here, let&rsquo;s just say the April update was a surprise I didn&rsquo;t know would happen.</p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/">1000xRESIST</a></h3>
<p>I played the demo of this game early in this year and I left the demo, commenting that its writing was a bit &ldquo;depressive&rdquo;. While I have complaints on its gameplay getting the players to interact in ways unrelated to the story, I will admit the game has a strong tone from its introduction alone.</p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1584090/Touhou_Mystias_Izakaya/">Mystia&rsquo;s Izakaya</a></h3>
<p>I think everyone has said their thoughts on the comfy writing and gameplay of Mystia&rsquo;s Izakaya, so I will instead focus on the notable parts I saw in DLC 4 and DLC 5.</p>
<p>I loved how the writer messed with common preceptions on Yuuka, by making Mystia fear Yuuka from the rumors about her, yet the twist is that Yuuka is a friendly person despite the rumors.</p>
<p>Mima became a star-eyed genius, which while she is now lacking in her sense of practical jokes, her insights are what to be expected out of the magician profession. That something that I head canon to Mima to be, to an extent, that Mima holds herself in greater regards despite her hijinks she does in the canon Touhou games.</p>
<p>Louise is a travel blogger, which to be honest, there isn&rsquo;t that many characters in media that are travel bloggers, so her characterization is already unique in that regard. Anyway, I can relate much to Louise being a fellow who enjoys a bit of reading on other places around the world, and as a researcher who wants to shine a light on more obscure media. I can backup that her experiences are definitely for a desire to connect to people.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the Lunar Capital&rsquo;s molecular gastronomy, thinking about how this brand of gastronomy could be applied within the real world. It is actually a great way to keep future technology vibe Lunar Capital going since gastronomy is the main aspect of Mystia&rsquo;s Izakaya, showing both their advancements and culture that differ from Gensokyo. Well done in adding a fictional set of food to their game!</p>
<p>Wrapping up, I waved a last goodbye to this game by doing every concert back to back and listening to each of the songs. It was a good experience to save up for this moment, while I reflected on the game success on the Touhou community across the world.</p>
<h3>Three Touhouwares!</h3>
<p>This is a personal challenge with the goal to beat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/772260/NitorInc_Touhou_Microgames/">NitorInc.</a>, <a href="https://para-dot.itch.io/bankiware">Bankiware</a>, and <a href="https://slascoplerd.itch.io/senkai-livin">Senkai Livin&rsquo;</a> all at the same time. Not only did I find out there a degree of luck in which mircogames are safe to be stalled on, but I also found there are some key differences between these Touhouwares in control layout and gameplay style. Sorting that all out by using AutoHotKey to find an ideal keyboard setup to be paired by mouse and figuring out how to control or stall on the mircogames was a learning experience. Though, I can be glad to report that this challenge was a success.</p>

<h2 id="summary touhou-game-jams">Touhou Game Jams</h2>
<a href="\images\indexes-extras\game-list\2024\Touhou Game Jam.webp"><img src="\images\indexes-extras\game-list\2024\Touhou Game Jam.webp" style="max-height:400px;" /></a>
<h3><a href="https://espeon78.itch.io/to-soar">To Soar</a></h3>
<p>Unlike all the other flappy bird games submitted for Touhou Fan Game Jam 12, this differentiated itself from the rest by changing how to pipes moved on screen. Let&rsquo;s just say it turned those pipes into a spellcard while still limiting the movement to flappy bird&rsquo;s controls. It can be a bit challenging, but it fits with the narrative this game offers, so I let the challenge slide this time around.</p>
<h3><a href="https://async-fish.itch.io/cirnos-rythm-revenge">Cirno&rsquo;s Rhythm Revenge</a></h3>
<p>It has some nice music and nice palette of colors to go with its fairy birds. Otherwise, it is usual rhythm game fair.</p>
<h3><a href="https://jwapobie.itch.io/flan-and-the-highway-to-hell">Flan and the Highway to Hell</a></h3>
<p>Truly a retro game, as the simple Outrun gameplay to drive Flandre&rsquo;s motorcycle through tracks is engaging, while the game&rsquo;s story foretells of Flandre&rsquo;s desires to keep on racing despite the objections she received to not go on. Its storytelling is helped from doing little explicit narrative, and more on environmental visuals.</p>
<h3><a href="https://jacoder23.itch.io/dimly-dreamt-lotus-flowers">Dimly Dreamt Lotus Flowers</a></h3>
<p>For a game made in three days, the writing is topnotch with the humorous school experience with Yuuka. Though, the last puzzle involving ambigrams was unexpected to say the least. I enjoyed that part personally since I played Void Stranger, but I don&rsquo;t expect that part to be effective to everyone as that puzzle does little to the narrative of the game. Regardless, this is a visual novel that I would like to read again thanks to its humor and characterization of Yuuka.</p>
<h3><a href="https://minute.itch.io/golden-hearts">Golden Hearts</a></h3>
<p>The author&rsquo;s skill in weaving Touhou details with sensory language is what defines their writing. Dialogue that is goofy and friendly all the same, and the addition of narration helps transition scenes cleanly. It&rsquo;s rich writing, despite being comedy focused.</p>
<h3><a href="https://iratebovine.itch.io/the-trials-of-aromantic-reimu">The Trials of ARomantic Reimu</a></h3>
<p>I liked how each of the characters Reimu faced were given unique music themes and color palette, setting the tone for each character. Aside from that, I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect the story to talk about Reimu&rsquo;s role of the Hakurei shrine maiden and how there must always be a shrine maiden in Gensokyo to keep the peace. That differentiated the story from other Touhou stories, since the role of the shrine maiden is specific to Reimu where the plot of this story couldn&rsquo;t work with any other character in Touhou. The story is specific to Reimu only, and that make this story stand out among other Touhou stories.</p>
<h3><a href="https://magpieteahouse.itch.io/ranspamremovalservice">RanSpamRemovalService</a></h3>
<p>Simple controls and good presentation that resolves around the task of Ran acting as IT support for Yachie&rsquo;s computer. Frankly, this could be a boss microgame in Warioware.</p>
<h3><a href="https://reale-ly.itch.io/possession-in-plain-sight">Possession in Plain Sight</a></h3>
<p>Using clues to figure out which person is processed by Mizuchi on a given floor plan is an original idea. There a lot of promise of extending this idea to a full game.</p>
<h3><a href="https://wwhhff.itch.io/duet">DUET</a></h3>
<p>This is a type of narrative I have not seen before in Touhou games, by removing all dialogue and using only visuals to tell its story. For its originality, that allows for telling Renko&rsquo;s tale before and after she met Maribel.</p>
<h3><a href="https://fmkr-project.itch.io/keine">Keine-Sensei&rsquo;s Perfect History Class</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a niche game for those interested in history where the two historic facts are compared to each other under Keine&rsquo;s formula, but even for those who don&rsquo;t enjoy searching up real-world history, it has to be admitted that the game has good presentation. Plus, I enjoy the interactions with Keine, Akyuu, and Kosuzu trying figure out how valid Keine&rsquo;s formula really is. It a weird way to sort history like this, but it appeals to my taste.</p>
