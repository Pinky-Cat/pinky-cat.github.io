It is finally time I took a look at Distant Union's books for the reading log, since I was who posted about Distant Union on the Touhou Lost Media thread. More on the circle for later on the entry as for today, I read three books that could only be found on Distant Union's website: The Gensokyo Menagerie Vol. 1, The Gensokyo Menagerie Vol. 2, and Over My Hot Youkai Body. As The Gensokyo Menagerie volumes were collaborative books between multiple artists I will comment on the highlights of the books, while I review Over My Hot Youkai Body on its own merits.

### The Gensokyo Menagerie Vol. 1
I liked shadowy landscape of Sigmud's first artwork as it puts Gensokyo in the lens of a fantasy novel by showing the important locations of Gensokyo all in one artwork. It gives the vibe that Gensokyo is more interconnected than it actually is in canon, but that view is nice.

Shoot, I think I have a new favorite artist in the form of Rubin. The small Yoshika and Kogasa comic is cute and the colored version of the comic's background on Distant Union's website feels amazing to look at. I also liked Luise's Trip to Gensokyo! by Rubin, for giving Louise (and Sara) a fan comic. It a bit short, but I will have admit that Rubin's artwork on the last page is as wonderful for its color use similar to the art of Ask Kogasa - A Lonely Umbrella.

### The Gensokyo Menagerie Vol. 2
Woah, the art of Rubin's Hanging By a Thread is quite charming and rustic at the same time. The omake states Rubin that used water color for this story, and that really comes when seeing Wriggle be in awe of Yamame's snitching.

On the other hand, Jade's Cursed Games, made me laugh for the progressive hijinks that Sanae finds herself in after she finds a ukulele and Scrabble? Yep, this is defiantly a serious Touhou story.

### Over My Hot Youkai Body by Jade
I don't know what is weirder, that Remilia worries about the nutrition of her food, or that Meiling is reading National Geographic. But anyway, the way Jade draws the characters reminds me of Adventure Time, seeing as there faces are simple lines for a moment, then they are drawn with muscle detail for other moments.
