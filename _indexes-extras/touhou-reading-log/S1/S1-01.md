Disusedtopia is a full-color illustration book that describes the memories of Kogasa Tatara while she lived in the care of her family. Her memories recount the time she played with their daughter during rainy days by catching frogs. Those are the usual activities children do after all. Though, those were only a recounting of memories from over ten years ago ever since Kogasa was abandoned to the waste dumps.

The rest of story is about Kogasa's time at the Waset House which takes care of all sorts of abandoned objects. There, Kogasa plays with her new family - now composed of objects. This part was quite cute to read admittedly.

Of course, nothing lasts forever, so objects started to leave the Waset House as their caretaker took the objects to their "mother". And this continued until Kogasa was the only one left. Alone again, Kogasa went to see the caretaker in secret. But she found the caretaker did not take objects to their "mothers", but rather sent them to the fiery blazes of of an incinerator. Upon being spotted, Kogasa ran out while the caretaker chased her, before tripping on her feet and setting the mansion in blazes.

There was nothing left of the mansion aside from Kogasa. With nowhere to go, Kogasa was left on the streets again where Kogasa faded away with no left to take care of her.

Admittedly, when I was ordering from Suruya-Ya, I would have preferred grabbing an older doujinshi of Kotoinari since his art style between the latter half of 2016 and the end of 2017 was what I considered a transition period. His art style stopped using unique body shapes in favor of a standard body shape, and colors began to be much more saturated compared to the drab colors of before. But this was one of the only doujinshi available for purchase online, so I went with Disusedtopia.

As for how I think of this doujinshi, I liked how the simple illustrations accompanied the story's text on the other pages. It made each story beat impactful seeing how Kogasa has risen and fallen in her situation. But most of the pages are filled with white space outside of Kotoinari's art, making the doujinshi as an illustration book lose some flavor for feeling sanitized.

However, if there is one area Kotoinari kept consistent in this transition period, it is how he tackles topics. In my mind, this story tells the experience of an orphan through Kogasa, and the Waset House is simply an orphanage for objects. Think of objects as children in the sense that they cannot act on their own without "parental care", thus abandoned objects can be viewed as orphans when their "parents" stop using the objects. In Kotoinari's story, an orphan has few options to go to aside from going to an orphanage or to sleep on the streets. And both options as shown by Kotoinari, are undesirable for the potential abuses, or the lack of help respectably. It is a bit of a twist on the caretaker role of Kogasa in the original canon and shows the true horror of Kotoinari; his ability to twist Touhou around non-Japanese topics in a bit of a satirical sense.

Before I finish this entry, searching up the name Waset pulls up results for the Egyptian city of Thebes, which was also known as Waset. Though, I can only say there is a relation in the sense that Kotoinari picked a name with Western roots. And I doubt the name is related to the predatory academic publisher WASET which has held fake conferences in the name of artificially boosting one's credit in the academic world. Then again, a Touhou doujinshi featuring Okazaki Yumemi finding herself in a fake conference in an attempt to prove her research is real sounds like the sort of topics Kotoinari would target for.
