A short MariAli book for today, featuring a little pouting from Marisa about her perceived inadequacy when compared to Alice. Fortunately, Alice reminds Marisa that she too, has her own strengths that Alice does not have.

The story is what I describe as sweet and soft as there isn't much of a deeper conflict aside from the one conflict Marisa has, which is resolved by Alice. Not much development, but this fault can be explained by how jiayi was pressed for time to release this book by MariAli day.

That aside, I will state my opinion on Touhou ships. I am neutral on them, rather how much I enjoy a Touhou ship depends on how well the writing develops the ship. In my opinion, I prefer a more realistic/humanistic approach to relationships between Touhou characters; a focus on the more tinder moments. More explicit feelings should be risen to and not be handled out so freely as to me that feels like an unrealistic relationship that feels wishful. It should be acknowledged that my opinion would conflict with the reason to write such ship stories, to describe an impossible relationship under social norms, which is why I would like to say I like to mention one example of a "ship" story.

[Higan's Camellia](https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-591597) is a KomAkyuu story that has excellent buildup of drama as Komachi realizes the consequences of befriending a child of the Miare. The buildup of drama is done as the Akyuu's days to death come closer and closer, while Komachi tries to pull some strings at the Ministry of Right and Wrong to see if there is a way to save Akyuu before everything is said and done. When Akyuu's death day arrives, a ceremony that acts both as her funeral and as her transport to the Ministry of Right and Wrong starts, with her executor being none other than Komachi. The tension is at its highest.

While the events described in Higan Camellia do not reflect in the Outside World, the drama makes their relationship truly heartfelt as both Komachi and Akyuu have to consider how their relationship should continue given their unique life circumstances to each other. Higan Camellia is not just a relationship of love but also describes the steps to their relationship. And to tie this back to my opinion on ships, this simply creates writing that is more in-depth, and more humanistic for its given ship.

Of course, the amount of drama in Higan Camellia is not required for me to like a ship story. [Echoing Hearts](https://minute.itch.io/touhou-echoing-hearts) is focused more on the moment-to-moment lifestyle of Kyoko and Kutaka, and that visual novel was one I felt needed the best rating for the writing category in Touhou Pride Game Jam 5. Simply put, I like to see the microcosms that come with such relationships, and as such I like to end this entry by returning to not good enough with a concluding line: seeing the lighter moments can be good relief all on its own.
