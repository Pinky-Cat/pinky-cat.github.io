This comic is about Orin's perspective on when Okuu ate a god to become a nuclear bird. What I love about Orin's perspective is that it describes what happened to Okuu's body after eating that sun god as eating a god that supposed to represent a ball of over 15 million Celsius has consequences.

Okuu is lying in bed with a scarred front, a missing right arm, and a newly formed eye that pops out in the middle of her chest. Orin worries over Okuu, they fuss over Satori's rebuke for Okuu's actions, and then they sleep together warmly to heal their damages. Afterward, Okuu figures out a right arm prosthetic, Okuu and Satori find new clothes for Okuu, and Orin does the final cuts on Okuu's new clothes to breathe air into that chest eye of hers. It's lovely seeing friends taking care of their injuries together and seeing Okuu's appearance by the end of the comic makes me appreciate what Orin and Satori have done for her. It is not often we see Touhou characters get injuries that are drastic like losing limbs and having permanent scars; that just won't happen in canon for how impactful it would change a character to lose so much by injury to the body. That is all I have to say for a lovely story that brings its own dose of originality as a derivative work of Touhou.

By the way, a reader that goes by the username [kymoh](https://moriyashrine.org/profile/41313-kymoh/) commented that their favorite work on the reading log so far is the comic [Manjuu](https://moriyashrine.org/forums/topic/7559-touhou-reading-log/?do=findComment&comment=22030) because of the artist's exaggerated style. To me, I agree with that statement seeing how that exaggerated style gave the comic a unique design that stands, plus the Myouren Temple's were expressions humorous to me. Now, to connect this comment back to today's entry, Orin's Story, I say both Manjuu and Orin's Story both messed with the usual proportions of Touhou characters. While Manjuu gave the Myouren Temple atypical expressions for humor, Orin's Story goes though a body healing process to narrtively express the love Orin and Satori have for Okuu. All of these artistically different designs on Touhou character reminds me of [the artist もりっしー](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/4590152/manga), who draws Touhou character with differing proportions. Take a look at [this artwork featuring the Subterranean Animism characters reading the artist's doujinshi](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/85073317). Note the giant hairy arms of Yamame in the background. See how small Okuu and Orin are in comparison to Satori. Does Yamame feels more like a monstrous spider crawling underground? Doesn't the small statue of Okuu and Orin make them more huggable? By messing with size, the artist has given viewers one more characteristics to get the feel of a character, and this is all in addition to the artist's well-rounded approach to expressions. Also, this artist like to employ some jokes with their character depictions, for example Okina is always seen by their back. No exceptions. Not even when the artist created [an artwork featuring Okina in a grand slam against the fairies when she is surrounded on all sides](https://x.com/i/web/status/1132197997507252225). All in all, もりっしー is a favorite artist of mine for his character designs the same way Manjuu and Orin's Story messed with character design to create unique comics.

More artists should try to experiment with Touhou character designs in more ways than their clothing. ZUN already changes clothing design with his characters, so how about trying a different way to mess with character design? It can be more than eye candy as seen with Orin's Story, and having narrative reason for character's visual appearance is taking the extra step.
