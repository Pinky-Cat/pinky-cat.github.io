I wonder when the first purple umbrellas were created? Well, it doesn't matter to Kogasa now that she lives in Gensokyo.

Rubin has a nice brush texture and color palette to go along with the scenes such that Kogasa's emotions feels more proactive with this woven atmosphere. The backgrounds are very empty, but the colors of the Touhou characters serve to stand them out.

Anyway, not much to say other than mention this comic was created as a response to multiple asks on the [Tumblr blog Ask Kogasa](https://ask-kogasa.tumblr.com/). There some more lovely art and animations of Kogasa on there, but the real power of Ask Blogs was the ability to converse with a fictional character and get a response from them. For now, it serves as a nice art gallery that reflects a form of internet culture long gone from now.
