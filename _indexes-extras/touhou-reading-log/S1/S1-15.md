On July 31st, 2012, the Touhou Tuesday podcast interviewed Helepolis from Holland about his trip to Japan. In addition, they discussed the circumstances that led Helepolis to stay over at warugaki's home and led to warugaki creating the subsequent report manga out of their international exchange.
As for the finer points discussed in that podcast, about Helepolis' organization of his Japan trip, about warugaki's work with regard to his incredible imitation of other art styles, the differences in convention organization in Japan versus the US, and that Helepolis decided to go to Reitaisai directly while cosplayed as Amakasu Barley Tenji from Uwabami Breakers. With the way the interview went, it framed Helepolis' trip as an amazing cultural exchange between two Touhou fans with many amusing accidents along the way. With all this information from the podcast, I had to check out warugaki's report manga, A Dutch Person is Staying Over!, to see how warugaki's illustrated his experience with Helepolis.

I have two things to say about warugaki's report manga: it is absolutely true that warugaki can imitate other art styles, and that warugaki is able to dramatize his experiences for the purposes of humor. In addition, I had my fair share of my own laughs knowing the context of the events in the report manga thanks to Helepolis' interview. Honestly, comparing both Helepolis' interview and warugaki's report to each other managed to be humorous by how similar the details were across different mediums. All in all, this report manga is as ridiculous as this Touhou exchange, and I be sure to take a look at warugi's Reitaisai 9 report manga just to see how Helepolis managed Reitaisai while in his cosplay.
