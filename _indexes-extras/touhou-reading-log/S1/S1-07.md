> *"When Doremy ventures inside a volatile nightmare, she meets Alice, an anxious girl desperate to escape from the hands of the "Demoness". Help Doremy and Alice in this Point-and-Click Visual Novel game!"*

As I have some pressing obligations I should be taking care of, I have decided to read a short visual novel for today.

I have a thought about why most Touhou characters seem to never change and I find that one possible reason is that these characters do not lose nor gain more responsibilities after their initial character introduction. Remember when Wriggle tried delivery service? She forgot about that service, and that is how it goes for most characters as they temporarily gain responsibilities to conduct a role. These actions never become a lasting "raison d'etre" integrated into themselves that adds to the character. Of course, there are exceptions. Tenshi is a classic example of character development via additional responsibilities, namely Shion. Let us face the facts, SWR Tenshi was a pain precisely because she was raised in Heaven without going through the proper training, so Tenshi was bored of Heaven's reward of an unchanging paradise and destroyed the Hakurei Shrine as a result of her boredom. And that could be all, until Tenshi met Shion and all of a sudden Tenshi now has to care for people with proper mannerisms, for Shion has her fair share of issues that Tenshi can help be there for her. That was the responsibility added to Tenshi, and why her character received a major glowup after AoCF. Now, let's extend this topic to the visual novel at hand by talking about Alice instead.

So, I liked the visual novel's story for how it tackled Alice's nightmares as a conflict with Alice's dream to follow her own responsibilities, instead of following the responsibilities the "Demoness" placed on Alice. This is shown as chronological change by observing the dream for objects of child Alice's room, showing how child Alice gained the dream to create a living doll of her own. In the visual novel, that child Alice becomes Alice as shown in a series of flashbacks where began to break ties with the "Demoness" to become her own being, leaving for Gensokyo where the rest is history for Alice.

Reviewing the visual novel technically, I will start out by saying that the visuals and soundtrack fits within the context of navigating a dream memory: vivid colors and quiet tones. On the other hand, I have a mirror criticism that the writing can be a bit brief with the way certain scenes are resolved. It makes scenes end peacefully without fully drawing out the moment. I also wish there was a transition between the dollmaker minigame and its flashbacks as the sudden music change is a bit abrupt in appreciating the flashbacks. Again, minor issues when compared to the clear polish it has as a final college project. It is pretty amazing and mature that Touhou could be mixed at school at such a high level. Perhaps that is the role of adding responsibilities to oneself which some refer to that as "aspiration".
