This comic is about Aya talking to Hatate about Momiji where Aya makes some not-so-subtle hints on her affection to Momiji.

On the structure of the comic, this comic feels short despite the 21 page count as it uses the same 4korma paneling for the entire comic. In addition, the conflict plays a smaller role as the conflict is more about how Momiji feels reluctant at first to recuperate to the advances made by Aya, rather than trouble with an existing relationship.

Clearly, this comic is not meant to be earth shattering writing, like if there were more references about the Tengu society's caste system with regards to the different jobs Aya and Momiji inhabit. No, it is simply a celebration of an Aya and Momiji ship. Through, since the development of the relationship quickly ends on their first date within the comic this work does little outside of those who enjoy the Aya and Momiji ship. It is fine as a fan creation, but as a work of writing I would find that Puppy Love is a funny prologue to a relationship between Aya and Momiji. All that left is to wonder then, is if there is any Touhou literature that focuses on developing Tengu society in its writing. It would make for some heavy development in Tengu relationships.
