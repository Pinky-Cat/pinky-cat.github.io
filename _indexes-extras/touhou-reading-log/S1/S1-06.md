A foreign man goes for a walk to Xavier Park and rests at Sakai Lighthouse. He finds a girl in a raddled sailor uniform lying on the ground who, in a drunken stupor, begins to tell the man her sea-worthy stories. She leaves with a cat-eared affiliate, but not before the man guesses the uniformed girl's name to be Murasa Minamitsu. In light of this confirmation, Murasa leaves an annoyed comment about Yukari, while the man begins to write down from memory the stories of Murasa as a record to compare with naval history. This intro is the framing this book uses to contain two different subjects in the same book: Naval history and Touhou artwork.

Of the former, Captain Murasa's Stories is a naval history book that features the ships of Great Britain, Germany, and Japan, all accompanied by photos and artwork. For my personal feelings, the writing intrigued me as much as a good history book knows to tell historical facts as part of a narrative. Reading the reason behind the ships' creation, seeing their action out on the war operations, and having geopolitics context for their movements made me feel a rich connection to essentially the life stories of ships. This is all aided by U-Joe's rich art style, where the sea endlessly waves, the sky sets great color balance, and the ships acting as the focal pieces. These artworks serve to highlight the ships for these present times.

Of the latter, Captain Murasa's Stories is a Touhou artbook that carries heavy Western inspiration in both style and subject. As mentioned before, U-Joe is rich in his art style as the environments are wonderfully lush of nature's eccentrics, while Touhou characters are outfitted in far more fashionable styles. His subjects can vary where one can see Aya flying over the stormy sea, while another artwork depicts Alice serving tea to a blond child sitting in a well-lit living room. U-Joe also wonderfully mixes Western subjects with Touhou in both environment and clothing, such that artworks still look like a dream more in line of a past European era not fettered by the fright of recent invasions.

To think that a Touhou fanwork would make me interested in reading the life of a British air carrier for the past hour is indicative of how Touhou can connect vastly different subjects together. Perhaps the true subject of Touhou is something less material, liken to a dream or spirit. Perhaps the art of U-Joe was how the book created an unimaginable marriage between the sea and Touhou.

Before leaving this entry out to dry, I like to mention a quote the book uses under ЁКАИ И ФЕИ (YOUKAI AND FAIRIES):

> Мариса: Какая у тебя роль, Фландре?

> Фландре: Моя роль - разрушение.

> Мариса: Хмм, но никто в этом мире не заслуживает такой
роли.

> Фландре: Твоя роль - человек. Обычный человек.

> Мариса: Поэтому я свободна. Эта сцена не в силах меня ограничить.

> Фландре: Я – демон. Демоны тоже свободны, верно?

> Мариса: Нет. Разве ты не знаешь сказок?

> FelisOvum, «Cendrillon»

> перевод – RainСat

The name *Cendrillon* caught my eye, for that doujinshi is not a typical Touhou doujinshi. While its author, FelisOvum, is certainly inspired to add Western subjects in the same way U-Joe does in his art, the narrative of the doujinshi stands out for trying to tell a theme that extends beyond its roots of a Touhou doujinshi. I recommend checking out the doujinshi, if not but to see the sort of artwork that could be created back in 2008.
