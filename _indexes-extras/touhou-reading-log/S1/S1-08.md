Fairy Fiesta is a series zines celebrating Cirno that has continuously released every Cirno Day since 2019. Each zine is packed filled with art and stories related to Cirno from all sorts of artists and writers. In addition, each zine has its own unique theme setting zines apart while keeping the focus on the icy fairy, Cirno.

Now, reviewing zine for the log is bit weird because these zines feature so many different artists and writers that these isn"t a consistent aspect to critique on these zines. Truly, these zines are meant more as a celebration showcase rather than being a organized tale, not that celebratory work isn"t meaningful on its own.

What I can say is that these zine feature quite the diverse set of art styles, some I have never seen even in Touhou art online. That alone is worth checking out, since I believe traditional social media"s search algorithms would be unfavorable to the exposure for some of the art. Gives a benefit to creating zine since the works are handpicked all together.

In light of the highly artistic zines, the rest of the entry will simply highlight some parts of the work that I find to be notable in a sorta graphic design/framing sense. As a reminder these zines are available for free on their [Itch.io page](https://dotzines.itch.io/), so check them out!

### Fairy Fiesta Sweet! Table of Contents
Fairy Fiesta Sweets! was the only one to get a table of contents, perhaps because the works in this zine were organized by the type of sweet used: candies, drinks, keki, and "i-screams". Fittingly, the table of contents take on the appearance of a diner menu, listing out the creator as their title, their work"s sweets, their price, and some additional warnings like "May contain unwanted surprises". That packs charm, plus I now feel hungry for some leftover Halloween candy.

### The Fairy Frog Flower Festival
Hopping on page 17 of Fairy Fiesta Frog!, unlike other writing works included in the zine, this poetic work uses a completely original design for its background, formatting, fonts, and colors. As for the poetry, it is five sections with similar rhyming schemes that give just enough to figure out the fairy it describes though a froggy description.

### Fairy Fiesta RPG! Cover
In my opinion, this is the best cover out of all the zines so far because this cover isn"t simply just Cirno. By allowing additional characters, each of them adds their unique expression to the cover, thus breaking monotony of the strongest fairy, Cirno. Also, this covers does well to reference the covers of old adventure games and I get the feeling of the story going, "Can Cirno"s fairies beat the dark Magicians and save the world?". Lastly, the designs of their clothing are pretty gorgeous. Everyone has their share of extra fills, but I have to give special attention to Marisa and Patchouli for their new coats. Marisa looks fits for a lord taking the world"s treasure, while Patchouli retains her "pajama" design but reimagined to fit with modern fashion. All in all, this is quite the eye catching cover.
