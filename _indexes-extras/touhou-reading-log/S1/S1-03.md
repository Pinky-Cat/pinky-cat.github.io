This doujinshi is about how Patchouli gets her hands on a book that appears to be everyone's secrets in Gensokyo. Hijacks ensure over Patchouli's sudden "knowledge".


As the release was digital, the manga is in full color and my goodness do the colors help complement the art quality! The emotion and movement of characters are emphasized better in full color. This, of course, makes the humor bounce off the pages.

But this scene with Sakuya's time stop shows the potential of a full-color doujinshi where the world transitions into grayscale while Sakuya is highlighted in yellow. The colors made characters able to create separate scenes within the same manga.
In addition, I have to say that the doujinshi's paneling is more in line with a comic, which gives a more consistent flow to pacing. Now compare that with a comedy doujinshi's paneling where paneling can suddenly turn into 4-koma, or turn into intermission pages. I have to admit, the more professional quality of Nostrafort made me enjoy the humor a bit more when the pacing is felt right.
By the way, the credits show sixteen people from Nostrafort are listed, which is far larger a team compared to a Touhou doujinshi! Has there ever been a non-joint Touhou doujinshi that had that many people working on one doujinshi? Anyway, that helps contribute to the professional quality the manga gave off while reading. And with that, I would like to recommend this manga to those looking for Touhou comedy, especially as the manga is available online.
Having said that about the quality of the manga, Nostrafort is no longer active due to internal drama from some of its members. Bit of a shame, but that is how it is sometimes when it comes to art.
