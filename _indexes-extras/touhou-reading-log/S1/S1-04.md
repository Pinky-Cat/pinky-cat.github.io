That cover is all that is needed to know about the content of this comic. But seriously, the comic gives each member of the Myouren Temple just enough characterization that allows for the humor to bounce between the character interactions.

This especially helps with how Shadowjackery's art style certainly gives off indie comic book vibes, but humor never needed the best art to work. Plus, the creator's character designs help give each character their own style of reactions, some of them being amusing to me.

Before wrapping up this entry, I have to mention it is ironic to read this comic after reading The Never-ending Book with its sixteen-member team. It shows how good comedy is easier for artists to create compared to other genres, and if I remember correctly, comedy is one of the most popular genres for Touhou doujinshi.
