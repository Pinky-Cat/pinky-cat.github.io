Touhou in Malaysia is a short historical doujinshi on the Touhou fandom in Malaysia,  forming their first cosplay group to the creation of the group Malaysian Touhou Brigade, which would organize many offline and online Touhou activities over the years.


From the beginning, the book talks about the nature of the first organized Touhou group as a community group. While the group was focused on fighting games, due to Hisoutensoku's influence, the book notes the friend connections the group made by both its gaming activities paired with its offline activities.


Special note is made on AniManGaki for the 2012 expansion from university rooms to a convention center as a sign for the rise of anime in Malaysia, and for how AniManGaki uniquely focused on niche interest groups like Touhou.


Speaking of growth, this fighting Touhou game group would eventually decide to take on the name of Malaysian Touhou Brigade, MTB for short, to include more activities that Touhou fans partake in. In addition, MTB took advantage of their now large presence at conventions in activities they call as "Touhou Matsuri", which can range from screening fighting game matches on the big screen to selling Touhou doujinshi.

The latter half of the book focuses on how MTB was able to invite famous doujin members from Japan as guests for AniManGaki, noting that handling traveling logistics and giving their guests the best Malaysia experience was a team effort between AniManGaki and MTB. More interestingly, there is mention of Touhou fans across Southeastern Asia, like Indonesia and Singapore, where Touhou fans traveled across countries in Southeastern Asia to meet artists like D. watt.

After a short intermission on MTB's online experience from 2020, the book ends on reflection with the community experience Touhou fans have created for each other, and noting the growth of offline Touhou events from across the world like TouhouFest 2024.

### Thoughts
Reading the brief historical overview, this book is intended to show how dedicated a Touhou fan group can be. I mean the list of MTB activities is staggering ranging from: [selling doujin goods](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=986468100192271&), [screening a NitorInc. showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yecxilJb7AY), [organizing a Yuuhei Satellite concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA3fZy1zPpE), [hosting an online panel with ZUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p24JGVkU8A&t=163s). That is a lot to take in for someone living in the US, as there has never been a fan group to the extent of MTB's level. But, I digress on the differences the US has on offline fan activities compared to Asia, and instead say that the Touhou fandom can grow. That is what this short historical book tells me, even if that takes many years. I mean the impossible did happen in the US with the existence of TouhouFest, so I be more optimistic about where this fandom will be going in the future.

Before I close off on this entry, I want to shout out [kkcwkoh's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kkcwkoh92) for having so many video recordings of MTB's offline activities in one place. When I look for Touhou offline activities for a country like the US, I have to go across YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, DeviantArt, Maidens of the Kaleidoscope, and more to figure out what offline activities were done in the past. But for Malaysia, it is all organized into one Youtube channel, so check it out if you are interested in seeing how high a Touhou fan group from outside of Japan can go to!
