This time, Shadowjackery made a full-length comic that was funny to me. Every **single** page was a setup for a joke, yet this comedy kept the plot progressing at the same time. It made the pacing feel dynamic, and let the jokes come one after another. As a result, I laughed at the entire comic from beginning to end. I especially loved the amount of irony that happened with the methods the SDM used to defeat the monster. Plus, the characters' differing level of formal language amused me. Thus, I would like to give a personal recommendation for Rice Soup as a good Touhou comedy.
