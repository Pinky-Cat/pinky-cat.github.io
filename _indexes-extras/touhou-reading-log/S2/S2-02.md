Unlike her stints as president of the United States or as fast food employee of Burger King, this Miko is taking the responsible job of parenthood. It seems no matter where Miko goes, she finds a way to spin it to her advantage.

The humor is a bit dated from being strangely focused on the latest trends, though the author has admitted that the book had to be rushed for TouhouFest 2023, with the writing taking a hit as a result. Still, getting a book printed for a Touhou convention in the United States is certainly notable considering how few physical releases occur for Touhou books within the United States. Though, it seems that TouhouFest has impacted Touhou book publishing, with 2024 having a release with Forsaken Doll's Judgment and 2025 having an upcoming release with a novella about Sumireko. It is defiantly clear with the amount of physical book releases at TouhouFest that providing a physical space for Touhou fans has allowed for new ways for Touhou fans to distribute and interact with their works.
