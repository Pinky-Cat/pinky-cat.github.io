The humor is as expected as much as Ichirin's orders at were at Miko. But seriously, I laughed at the visual novel with how the Touhou characters were adapted to fit with the Burger King setting and all that entails within fast food restaurants. Add in some references to memes about fast food and that humor is kept fresh for the visual novel's short length.

Before I close out my order, the visual novel's soundtrack provided by [Uchulups](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkK2kI-oVcg8uplAgKuEiKBvV86f5s5ge&si=dpgNRmWOfUVBgZW2), deserves a good listening, especially for the track on Ichirin's theme. It has some neo-city vibes that feels calming to listen to.
